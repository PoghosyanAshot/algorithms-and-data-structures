Here is an explanation for a README file about your Bubble Sort implementation:

Bubble Sort
How It Works

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name because smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list with each iteration.

Your provided code implements this by:

Using a nested for loop.

The outer loop (i) controls the number of passes through the array.

The inner loop (j) compares each pair of adjacent elements (arr[j] and arr[j - 1]).

If arr[j] is less than arr[j - 1], it swaps them.

Time Complexity
Best Case: O(n) - This occurs when the array is already sorted. The algorithm still performs a full pass, but no swaps are needed. An optimization can be added to break out of the loop if no swaps occur, which would make the best case truly O(n).

Average Case: O(n 
2
 ) - This is the most common scenario.

Worst Case: O(n 
2
 ) - This occurs when the array is sorted in reverse order. The maximum number of swaps and comparisons are required.

Space Complexity
Space Complexity: O(1) - Bubble sort is an "in-place" algorithm. It does not require any additional memory that grows with the size of the input array. The only extra space used is for a few variables during the sorting process, which is constant.
